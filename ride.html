            Club rides take place in the evenings from the first week in April
            until the end of September. The Sunday ride takes place throughout
            the year. It would be nice to say that the rides happen in all
            weathers, but this is Wales and we're not that dumb. For the most up
            to date information, check us out on Facebook. The rides leave at
            the times shown below, so be there earlier and ready to go.

        <h2>The Different Groups</h2>
        <p class="white">
          The following is a guide only. It can be used to choose which group of
          riders you should aim for and what would be expected of you. Remember
          that average speeds are difficult to pin down and can be affected by
          the nature of the terrain and the weather conditions encountered. The
          distances mentioned aren't necessarily what you will encounter on the
          club rides, but they are what you should be capable of doing.
        </p>

        <h2>Novice Group</h2>
        <h3 class="white">
          Beginner ride for the novice that want to develop their skills and
          build fitness. Slower pace with only minor hills. This is a great
          introduction to group riding and a nice way to ease yourself into the
          club.
        </h3>
        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Aim - This group is aimed at the rider who has just started out, but
            has ridden a good number of times by themselves to build up a
            reasonable level of fitness.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Distance – 20-30 miles on rolling terrain. You'd be expected to ride
            20 miles in two hours or less and 30 miles in three.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Average Speed – Up to 12 mph.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Stops – Frequent stops along the route to rest and regroup.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Skills – You should have the skills necessary to fix a puncture and
            to be able to deal with a dropped chain for example. You should read
            the riding advice
            <a href="http://www.caerphillycc.co.uk/riding-advice/"> here.</a>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Equipment – Road or hybrid bike (no suspension).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="white space-around"></p>

        <h2>Steady Group</h2>
        <h3 class="white">
          Main club ride. Usually taking in a selection of hills. The ride is a
          more social pace. Often this will be split into groups of different
          speed.
        </h3>
        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Aim – This group is aimed at the rider who has been riding for a
            while and has built up a good level of fitness.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Distance – 30-40 miles on rolling terrain with some minor hills.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Average Speed – 12-14 mph.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Stops – You would be encouraged to minimise the number of stops
            along the route and to keep riding.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Skills – You’ve probably fixed the odd puncture by yourself.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Equipment - Road or hybrid bike (no suspension).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="white space-around"></p>
        <h2>Intermediate Group</h2>
        <h3 class="white">
          Usually taking in a selection of hills. This is the main club training
          ride for intermediate riders and is meant to be challenging for those
          taking part.
        </h3>
        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Aim – This group is aimed at the rider who has been riding for a
            season or two. Maybe entered the odd sportive and is really looking
            to push on.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Distance – 40-50 miles on hilly terrain.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Average Speed – 14-16 mph.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Stops – Stops along the route are now few and far between.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Skills – You can fix a puncture and a snapped chain. You should
            understand the etiquette and be completely comfortable with group
            riding and require little advice on riding skills.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Equipment – Road bike
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="white space-around"></p>
        <h2>Advanced Group</h2>
        <h3 class="white">
          This is the main club training ride for faster riders expect speed.
        </h3>
        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Aim – This is for the seasoned rider with a high level of fitness.
            You would likely have several sportives behind you and you are
            comfortable spending all day on a bike.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Distance – 50-70 miles over a very hilly course. You’ve probably
            done century rides.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Average Speed – 16-19 mph and higher again over a flat course.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Stops – Don’t expect any rest stops along the route and the pace
            will remain high throughout the ride.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Skills – You’ve probably had your bike in bits at some point and
            have enjoyed fixing it. You've ridden in a group and chain gang more
            times than you can remember and you have a lot of experience to pass
            on to other riders.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Equipment – If you haven’t a road bike by now, really what are you
            doing.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="white space-around"></p>
        <h2>Women's Group</h2>
        <h3 class="white">
          A ride for women only. The focus is on safe, interesting routes often
          with the challenge of hills.
        </h3>
        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            Aim – This ride is there to actively encourage female riders into
            the sport and to provide a comfortable environment for riding.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">
            This ride is often split into two groups. See novice and steady
            group information above for expectations.
          </li>
        </ul>
