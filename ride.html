            Club rides take place in the evenings from the first week in April
            until the end of September. The Sunday ride takes place throughout
            the year. It would be nice to say that the rides happen in all
            weathers, but this is Wales and we're not that dumb. For the most up
            to date information, check us out on Facebook. The rides leave at
            the times shown below, so be there earlier and ready to go.

        <h2>The Different Groups</h2>
        <p class="white">
          The following is a guide only. It can be used to choose which group of
          riders you should aim for and what would be expected of you. Remember
          that average speeds are difficult to pin down and can be affected by
          the nature of the terrain and the weather conditions encountered. The
          distances mentioned aren't necessarily what you will encounter on the
          club rides, but they are what you should be capable of doing.
        </p>
        <h2>Novice Group</h2>
        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush"  >
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary ">Aim - This group is aimed at the rider who has just started out, but has ridden a good number of times by themselves to build up a reasonable level of fitness.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary ">Distance – 20-30 miles on rolling terrain.  You'd be expected to ride 20 miles in two hours or less and 30 miles in three.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary ">Average Speed – Up to 12 mph.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary ">Stops – Frequent stops along the route to rest and regroup.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary ">Skills – You should have the skills necessary to fix a puncture and to be able to deal with a dropped chain for example.  You should read the riding advice <a ref="http://www.caerphillycc.co.uk/riding-advice/"> here.</a></li>
          <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary ">Equipment – Road or hybrid bike (no suspension).</li>
         </ul>
         <p class="white space-around"> </p>
         

         <h2>Steady Group</h2>
         <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
           <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">Aim – This group is aimed at the rider who has been riding for a while and has built up a good level of fitness.</li>
           <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">Distance – 30-40 miles on rolling terrain with some minor hills.</li>
           <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">Average Speed – 12-14 mph.</li>
           <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">Stops – You would be encouraged to minimise the number of stops along the route and to keep riding.</li>
           <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">Skills – You’ve probably fixed the odd puncture by yourself. </a></li>
           <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">Equipment - Road or hybrid bike (no suspension).</li>
          </ul>

         <ul class="list-group list-group-flush" >
           <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">Aim – This group is aimed at the rider who has been riding for a season or two. Maybe entered the odd sportive and is really looking to push on.</li>
           <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">Distance – 40-50 miles on hilly terrain.</li>
           <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">Average Speed – 14-16 mph.</li>
           <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">Stops – Stops along the route are now few and far between.</li>
           <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">Skills – You can fix a puncture and a snapped chain.  You should understand the etiquette and be completely comfortable with group riding and require little advice on riding skills. </a></li>
           <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">Equipment – Road bike</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="white space-around"> </p>
          <h2>Advanced Group</h2>
          <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">Aim – This is for the seasoned rider with a high level of fitness. You would likely have several sportives behind you and you are comfortable spending all day on a bike.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">Distance – 50-70 miles over a very hilly course. You’ve probably done century rides.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">Average Speed – 16-19 mph and higher again over a flat course.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">Stops – Don’t expect any rest stops along the route and the pace will remain high throughout the ride.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">Skills – You’ve probably had your bike in bits at some point and have enjoyed fixing it.  You've ridden in a group and chain gang more times than you can remember and you have a lot of experience to pass on to other riders.</a></li>
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">Equipment – If you haven’t a road bike by now, really what are you doing.</li>

           <h2>Women's Group</h2>
           <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
             <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">Aim – This ride is there to actively encourage female riders into the sport and to provide a comfortable environment for riding.</li>
